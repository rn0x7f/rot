# Caesar Cipher - Rotations from 1 to 25
This repository contains an implementation of the Caesar Cipher,
a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt texts using rotations from 1 to 25.
## Features
* **Automatic Decryption**: Attempts to decrypt the given text using every possible rotation (1-25).
* **Command-Line Interface**: Simple usage via the command line.
## Usage
1. Decryption: Run the script with the encrypted text as an argument:
~~~bash
./rot.sh encryptedtext
~~~
~~~bash
./rot.sh "encryptedtext"
~~~
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/rn0x7f/rot
~~~
